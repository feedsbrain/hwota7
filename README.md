# HWOTA7 for P9 EVA

### Huawei Rebrand Update Tools for P9 (EVA)
The original thread and script can be found in [XDA Forum](https://forum.xda-developers.com/p9/development/rebrand-update-tool-hwota7-p9-eva-t3820849 "XDA Thread"). While the script is working perfectly in Windows system. I feel like I need to modify the script a little bit to use in my Mac.

Feel free to use this script and read how to use this script in the original thread above. This script requires **adb** and **fastboot** executable from Android SDK. Just set the **$ANDROID_HOME** environment variable.

All the credits goes to the team at XDA.
